# Job Sequencing with Deadlines Visualizer

This project is a **visualization tool** for the classic **Job Sequencing with Deadlines** problem, implemented entirely in a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given a set of jobs, each with a deadline and profit, the goal is to schedule jobs to maximize total profit while ensuring that each job is completed within its deadline (only one job per time slot).

## 🚀 Features

* Interactive visualization of job scheduling
* Step-by-step execution with highlighted selections
* Console panel displaying decisions made by the algorithm
* Start and Reset controls for repeated runs
* Jobs sorted dynamically by descending profit

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Save the provided code as `index.html`.
2. Open the file in any modern web browser.
3. Click **Start** to watch the scheduling process.
4. Use **Reset** to restart the visualization.

## 🎯 Example Jobs

The default dataset includes:

* Job a → Deadline: 2, Profit: 100
* Job b → Deadline: 1, Profit: 19
* Job c → Deadline: 2, Profit: 27
* Job d → Deadline: 1, Profit: 25
* Job e → Deadline: 3, Profit: 15

The algorithm schedules jobs to maximize profit while meeting deadlines.

## 📖 Learning Outcome

This tool helps students and learners understand:

* Greedy algorithm design
* Job sequencing with deadlines
* How sorting by profit impacts scheduling decisions
